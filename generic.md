Hi I'm Paola or Pao as some like to call me. Ive always had a passion for technology. My interests are: software engineering, fullstack development, graphic design, 3d printing, back-end and front-end development, cloud services, coding, robotics, and automation engineering.

I graduated with my B.S. in Information Technology in 2016 and joined the Army Reserves in 2013 as an Intelligence Analyst. Currently I'm working as a Technical Sales Representative at Amazon Web Services (AWS).

I'm excited to further my talents and capabilities. AWS has a lot of available training that I'm grateful for. I also like to train on ACloudGuru, Linux Academy, Udemy, TutorialsDojo, Skillwise, and EduOnix. Last, I will like to grow my Automation Engineering and Software Engineering career.

Join me on this journey and connect with me or send me a friend request on LinkedIn if you share the same interests or would like to know more about me.
